## List Mate
An app for creating lists of items quickly and easily with just one thumb!

Entry for [Flutter Create 2019](https://flutter.dev/create)

I've chosen drinks to demonstrate this concept:

- Drag the blue cursor (FAB) to one of the drink options to start your selection.
- The opposite column will show you any further choices that are possible for the drink you've selected.
- If you've selected Coffee, for example, you can then choose to have a filter coffee, then you can choose milk, sugar etc until you're done.
- Continue making further refinements to your selection by holding onto the FAB until you're done then simply let go to save your selection.
